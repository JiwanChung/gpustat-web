Usage
-----

Launch the application as follows. SSH connections will be established to each of the specified hosts.
Make sure ssh works under a proper authentication scheme such as SSH key (e.g. `id-rsa`).
It is known that asyncssh [does NOT obey](https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh/issues/108) `~/.ssh/config` file
(e.g. alias, username, keyfile), so just be aware of this.

```
python -m gpustat_web --port 48109 HOST1 [... HOSTN]
```

Python 3.6+ is required.
